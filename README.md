SHARING MY NOTES AS WELL ! AS A SHORT NOTES BUT YOU CAN GO THORUGH THAT AS WELL THE MORE IMPORTANT IS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION  WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE GENAI APPLICATION.

THIS NOTES ALL ABOUT CORE CONCEPT OF BEHIND EVERY GENAI APPLICATION 
AND THIS REPOSITORY IS ALL ABOUT

STEP 1 ---------> DATA INGESTION
